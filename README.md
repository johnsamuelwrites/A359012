# A359012
Experiments on the integer sequence [A359012](https://oeis.org/A359012)

A359012 consists of a sequence of numbers k that are a substring of xPy where k=concatenation(x,y) and xPy is the number of permutations.

If x,y,k are natural numbers and k is formed by the concatenation of the digits of x followed by those of y, i.e., k = concatenation(x,y), then k belongs to A359012, if xPy contains the number k.


The first eight numbers are given below:
|k|x|y|permutations|
